                                    <p>The school emerges as a dynamic option through immersive courses (8-12 weeks) focused on technology, design and business. They have a strong and growing community: students who have common interests, skilled professionals instructors from a variety of industry backgrounds and a networking spread in important cities.</p>

                                    <p>Jim Ralley, from Hyper Island Manchester, told us about the school philosophy. The school is guided by the needs of the market when structuring the courses. The idea is to simulate the working environment, with experts and real projects. The students do not write articles: they make briefings and develop projects.</p>

                                    <p>We visited the school in Aarhus and joined the Team 20 class. Kaospilot offers a multi-sided education in leadership and entrepreneurship for a chaotic world. They centre on the students’ potential and proactiveness, tapping into their creativity, giving them some guidance, creating a setting that will help them to navigate through the uncertainties that will follow.</p>

                                    <p>They are an alternative, self-organized school where teachers propose classes and ask for barter items from students. In our case, we attended two classes: facilitating consensus and remapping the city. We offered to photograph the workshop and other students brought snacks and drinks – everyone helped in some way.</p>

                                    <p>The value of being part of Schumacher College is being part of the community and living in a light, warm and conscious environment. Waking up, meditating, eating, working and sleeping are part of the life in the college.  They approach education through the head, the heart and the hands; the learning comes from everything one has done as a part of a living and working community.</p>

                                    <p>A place to think about central emotional concerns, common to individuals of all ages and classes. The learning comes from philosophy, literature, psychology and visual arts. If one passes by The School of Life, one would think it's just another small store located in central London, but it’s actually a meeting point for many thinkers seeking inspiration for a better life.</p>

With around 70 students, aged 14 and over, it feels like a large multi-cultural family rather than like a boarding school. There is a friendly atmosphere of responsibility, co-operation and affection: everyone helps with the day-to-day decision-making and takes care of the grounds and buildings.</p>

                                    <p class="pre-split">A project-based learning initiative designed for students between the ages of 14 and 19. They are small schools (300 students each) teaching through enterprise projects, more like a workplace than a school. The small classes allow teachers and students to get to know each other better, making projects that meet not only the needs of the local community, but also the interests and skills of the students.</p>

The entrepreneurs – as they refer to the students – create teams mixing different individual skills. Each team organizes an enterprise during the three years of university.</p>
