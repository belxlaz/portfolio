                                <p class="pre-split">A series of workshops on Trend Report design and execution. This activity shared examples of exploratory research showing how emerging trends can influence particular audiences and brands. The analysis of the research material allowed the audience to design future scenarios as well as innovative products and services. The workshops took place in different Brazilian cities during 2014.</p>
